## Assignment 6<br>BUSI 721: Data-Driven Finance I<br>Rice University

1. Compute the historical means, standard deviations, and covariance matrix of the S&P 500, Treasuries, and Corporates using Damodoran's data (see 11-markets_portfolios.ipynb for a url to download the data).
2. Compute the global minimum variance portfolio.
3. Vary the target expected return on a grid from 4% to 12% and compute the minimum risk portfolio, allowing short sales but not using cash.  Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each portfolio and plot them.
4.  Assume the risk-free rate is 3%.  What is the tangency portfolio, allowing short sales?
