## Assignment 2<br>BUSI 721: Data-Driven Finance I<br>Rice University

1. You want to retire in 30 years with $1,000,000 in your retirement account. If your investments yield an annual return of 8% and you currently have no savings, how much should you save each year to reach your retirement goal?  Assume the savings are at the end of each year.

2. Suppose your returns are normally distributed with a mean of 8% and a standard deviation of 15%.  Suppose you save the amount you calculated in #1.  

  (a) Run a simulation to determine the probability that you will meet your retirement goal.
  (b)  Suppose the standard deviation is only 10%.  What is the probability of meeting your retirement goal?
  
2. You expect to receive the following cash flows: $5,000 in 1 year, $8,000 in 3 years, and $12,000 in 5 years. If the discount rate is 6%, what is the present value of these cash flows?

3. 
You are considering two investment options:

    A. Pays $1,000 in 2 years.

    B. Pays $1,500 in 5 years.

If your required rate of return is 7%, which investment should you choose based on their present values?
